# PremierLeague
Using Backend Framework: **Flask** and Frontend Framework: **React JS** 

- How to run the project: 

It is perferred to do this in virtual environment not to affect your installation

I am using Ubuntu: 

Install the following for the backend: 

pip install flask
pip install flask-mysqldb
pip install mysql-connector
pip install -U flask-cors

Run Backend Localhost: 

flask run 


Frontend: 

I added for you everything in npm, so you need to install npm if it is not availble in your laptop: 

then, in frontend directory, 

1) npm install
2) npm run 


- Remote Server I am using is https://www.freemysqlhosting.net/

- We agreed on the fact that we are not required to have a host. I also asked the doctor and told me that you would use local host
- Navigation: 
	The Web application has a username and register. Logging in is needed if you need to add review only. Otherwise, I see that 
	it is not required to know the information of the people. 
	Register, login. 
	- You have "TopTeams" to check the 5 required queries (top ten teams in terms of required ones). Click on the button to get the name and the score. 
	- You have all matches; click on anyone of them. You have two subsections: add review, and the reviews on this match. What should I do if I have a particular match I want to saw its reviews? You can simply go to google search! I will take more about it later
	- Similarly, you have all teams in team section. You can check its info inside each one of them. There are buttons if you wan to know the squad in each season. 
	- Players have all players in premier league. You will have all info, but what should I do if I want a specific player "google search section". 
	- Winning teams in each season query is simple as you can see. Just click on the button. You can see only one, because you need the teams in most games (so I asked the doctor and told me the best one). 
	- Stadiums section have all stadiums. 
	- The most important part is Google Search (Includes other queries). 
		- Getting players from nationality: Click on the button and fill in the form. Players will appear in the page. Click in anyone of them for further info.
		- The second query: Getting players info by first and last name. It will direct you to the player information page. If the name is wrong, it will give you an error message.
		- Getting Home team From stadtium (Write the stadium clearly, like London Stadium. You need to write London Stadium (exactly as in the premier league website). 
		- The third query: Getting players from position. The same thing will occur as in the nationatlity part.
		- The fourth query: Getting teams in a City. 
		- The fifth query: To get the reviews of a given match.
